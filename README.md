# Trading with Machine Learning
This project will take an investagitve project oriented dive into applying machine learning for stock market trading. 

This README will be continually updated as more projects are added to it.

## Folder Descriptions
### Practice
This folder contains jupyter notebooks experimenting with Multiperptron classifiers and Support Vector classifiers. They explore the importance of train test splits and hyperparamater optimization. 

### Algorithms
This folder contains jupyter notebooks investigating the different machine learning algorithms that will prove useful when it comes to the final demo notebook. It contains explanations and some sample code showcasing the algorithm.

## In Progress
### Portfolio Evaluator  

The idea of this project is to evaluate a user's portfolio's performance. 

It will factor in key metrics such as:
  - cumaltive return
  - average daily return
  - risk 
  - sharpe's ratio

It will offer functionality such as:
  - Ability to choose stock or cryptocurrency
  - select price or date bought in
  - evaluate portfolio performance based on a custom date range
  
### Portfolio Optimizer 

The idea of this project is to optimize a user's portfolio's performance.

It's design is as follows:
  - Provide a function for f(x) where x is the allocation of stocks 
  - This function is to be maximized for the sharpe ratio
  - Provide an initial guess for x 
  - Call the optimizer function
  - Testing
