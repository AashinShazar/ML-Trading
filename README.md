This project will take an investagitve project oriented dive into applying machine learning for stock market trading. 

This README will be continually updated as more projects are added to it.

## Folder Descriptions
### Demos
This folder contains jupyter notebooks demostrating application of machine learning used to optimize trading strategies. It is a continual work in progress and more demos will be added as soon as I can learn them.

### Algorithms
This folder contains jupyter notebooks investigating the different machine learning algorithms that will prove useful when it comes to the final demo notebook. It contains explanations and some sample code showcasing the algorithm.

## In Progress
### Portfolio Evaluator  

The idea of this project is to evaluate a user's portfolio's performance. 

It will factor in key metrics such as:
  - cumaltive return
  - average daily return
  - risk
